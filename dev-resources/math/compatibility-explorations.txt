Compatibility Equations

Equation 1
The first equation explores using the Gaussian function in 2 dimensions as a means by which compatibility coefficients in the middle range get more emphasis than those at the low and high ends.
y = c1 1/(σ Sqrt[2π]) E^(-((x-μ)^2/(2c2 (σ)^2
)))

Equation 2
This equation explores using an arctangent as a means by which compatibility coefficients in below middle range get less emphasis than those at  the high end.
y=π/4 ArcTan[π*x]*x
1/4 π x ArcTan[π x]

Equation 3
This equation explores using the inverse of the Gaussian function in 2 dimensions as a means by which compatibility coefficients in the upper and lower ranges get more emphasis than those in the middle.
y = 1 - c1 1/(σ Sqrt[2π]) E^(-((x-μ)^2/(2c2 (σ)^2
)))
1-(c1 E^(-((x-μ)^2/(2 c2 σ^2))))/(Sqrt[2 π] σ)
