a Python library for exploring emotional modeling in software agents

the name
========

This project was originally started in 2004 as "Emotional Modeling" or
"Emotional Models" (depending on which names were already taken in which hosted
code repository service).  Recent work on other game-related code bases (e.g.,
Myriad Worlds, DreamMUSH) caused interest to be resumed in this particular code
base. However, there's a long legacy of code here, and a fresh start was in
order.

After creating the "cweþan" project whose ultimate intended use is for NPCs in
text-based games, another Old English name seemed in order. After some poking
around in dictionaries, "innoþ" was chosen.

innoþ can mean "the inner part of the body", "the inside", "breast, heart,
stomach, womb, belly", or in reference to feeling, emotion, etc. It is cognate
to Old High and Low German words for viscera: "innethron" and "innod,"
respectively.

This is appropriate enough, at two levels:

#. The obvious application of this term is for what the library is trying to
   model rudimentarily: emotional states (which can then be used to inform
   behaviours);

#. At another level, simply to write this code, one must peer into the bowels
   of human nature, dig into its guts, cut it down to basic principles. This
   task is rather encompassing and is at the heart of any code that might be
   written to simulate what this inward-looking process might reveal.
