Compatibility Models

.. contents:: Table of Contents

The following are based upon related models for personality coponent
compatibility: the Big Five (FFM) and the IPIP (which extends the Big Five to
including 30 facets).

We make a departure from both of these models, however: Neuroticism and its
six facets (in IPIP) have been replaced with their opposites. This was done to
simplify the numeric models; with a positive category used instead, the fifth
personality component can be treated just like the other four.

For all models below, a compatibility level of 5 is the highest, and a level of
1 is the lowest.


Simplified Personality Model
============================

To explore the interactions between personalities and the dynamics that arise
between individuals and groups -- and to be able to visualize these interactions
easily -- a simplified 2-dimennsional model is provided.

Based on the Big Five, this model combines Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extraversion, and Agreeableness into one: Engagement. The other axis is
Stability.

Our model for the interactions of these components is as follows:

```
         Engag  Stabi
         -----  -----
Engag  |   5      3   |
Stabi  |   3      5   |
         ------------
```

Personal Interactions in the Simple Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a simple model of 2-dimensional vectors representing simplified
personalities, let's look at ways in which we might interpret these vectors
and their interactions with each other.


Component Interactions
----------------------

Let's define "interaction" as the numerical results obtiained by performing
various operations on any given vector or vectors. This section will strive to
identify what these operations may represent in the context of personality
component interactions.

Big Five Compatibility Matrix
=============================

The chart below explores a possible general model for how each domain in one
personality might be affected, to a lesser or greater extent, by every other
domain in a different personality.
