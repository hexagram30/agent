when describing a group of people after extensive study, the language used by
authors often directly translates into a description of their common goals,
standards, and preferences, and how they differ from other groups.  From this we
hope to derive a reusable database of archetypes, from which we can provide
agent authors a template to use in instantiating members of an organization.
