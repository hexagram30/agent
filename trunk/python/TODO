Structure of Modules:

emotion module receives input from the perception module

the perception module is moderated by the physiology module (python components?)

At each tick of the simulation clock, each agent must be able to process the following information:
* current state name or ID
* stress-based coping mode (Omega_i where i = 1,5)
* currently afforded transitions and what actions might cause those state transitions (a_nm in A(Omega))
* subjetive desires for each state based on 11 pairs of emmotional scales summed into an overall utility score, U

Using all of this information, the agent must select a decision style Phi and process the information in order to produce a best repsonse (BR) that maximizes expected, discounted rewards or utilities in the current iteration of the world.

Utility may be thought of as the simple summation of all positive and negative emotions for an action leading to a state.

After emotional intensity is obtained for each emotion, they need to be summed and averaged over the 11 ranges.
